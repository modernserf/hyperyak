# Why Computers

Why do we like computers? I don't mean why do we use computers -- they are _useful_, for sure, but I would never say i love refrigerators. But there was a moment in my life when I _fell in love_. Everybody in here's got a story. For a lot of you, i bet it was desktop publishing, when you realized that you could focus on the writing and the design and skip all the paper and glue nonsense. Maybe it was video games -- that moment when it dawns on you that theres a whole world inside the computer. Maybe it was on the information superhighway -- that moment you get an email from someone on the other side of the world.

The unifying idea behind all of these is that computers let our dreams become _real_ without having to become _physical_. Yet all three of these are fundamentally constrained. Quark and PageMaker are incredibly lively tools for making artifacts for a dead medium. Games let you explore someone else's world but give you few options to create your own. Any idiot can write an email but only a special kind of idiot can run a BBS.

# My first program

Quark and Zork are other people's ideas that we get to inhabit. How do we think thoughts that don't fit in other people's programs? I guess we have to write our own.

Now, I am a programmer. I find programming intrinsically satisfying -- this BASIC code right here was my "falling in love" moment. But even I know that getting from here to programming professionally? Well, it kind of sucked! Even the simplest useful program requires the level of expertise that can only be achieved through hours upon hours of drudgery. I cannot help but think of all the people who didn't have the time, the energy or the personality defects that I did -- hell, think of all the people who didnt have round-the-clock access to a computer to cultivate these skills. Think of all the software that will never be written -- are my ideas better than theirs just because I had the means to pursue them?

# users to programmers

This is not, by any means, a novel idea. There's been a tremendous effort in the last 10 years to make computers more accessible for regular people, and programming is certainly easier now than it was in the punchcard days. But there's this gulf between ordinary users and programmers. Between these two poles, theres a whole spectrum of human experience, but there's so little out there for them. Software publishers -- even for pro-level stuff -- see only diminishing returns for power-user features.

But i think the real culprits are us -- the "real programmers." I think we kind of _want_ programming to be hard, for it to be exclusive. When I see my peers talking about "real programming" or "dumbing it down", I see schoolboys perpetuating generations-old hazing rituals.

# hypermedia

It doesn't have to be this way. There are software paradigms that have something for people all across the spectrum, from user to programmer and everyone in between. Given that Buzz-Feed is a media company, I figured I should talk to you about _hypermedia_.

Now HyperMedia, in its simplest form, is a nonlinear collection of documents, connected by "hyperlinks". Typically, these documents are searchable and indexable, like a database. Now, that doesn't sound like much, but it covers a lot of use cases that would otherwise require custom software -- interactive presentations, electronic encyclopedias, even some simple games -- all without writing any code whatsoever. when you do hit the limitations of the paradigm, its a surprisingly good substrate for integrating traditional programming.

The germ of the idea goes at least as far back as the dawn of computers, and there have been quite a few implementations, but until fairly recently they’ve been limited to research labs and massively-expensive workstations. But Apple's HyperCard changed all this -- HyperCard takes ideas from hypermedia and object-oriented programming and puts them into an environment that can run on any Mac.

# Future of Programming

But this is a big picture talk; I'm not here to sell you HyperCard licenses. I want us imagine what our world could look like in -- I dunno, 25 years? -- if hypermedia tools — the descendants of HyperCard — really took off.

It’s a safe bet that computers in 25 years will be vastly more powerful, and that the internet will be vastly more widespread, but we need a little more vision to imagine a world without barriers between users and programmers.

So I’ll try to answer two questions: how will people across different levels of expertise work together? And: what role will programmers, as we understand them today, play in 2016?

# Authors

Now, buzzfeed is and has always been a multimedia company -- this goes all the way back to its founding in 1986 as a cat fancier's newsletter. Flash forward five years and now you have an incredible pool of interdisciplinary talent -- writers, editors, designers, journalists, filmmakers. These people are not programmers, but they're smart, media savvy people and they're here because they've got ideas beyond traditional media. What can their work look like? How are _we_ going to empower _them_?

# Abstraction

The first step is to give them a reliable system of abstraction. Ted Nelson, one of the pioneers of hypermedia, talks a lot about an idea he calls "transclusion" -- embedding documents into each other. Again, like hyperlinks its a very simple idea, but its got a lot of power to it.

# hyperbuzzfeed
The basic idea isn't much different from anything you'd see in desktop publishing -- dynamically loading content into different, fixed layouts.

This is a little fiddly in hypercard today, especially across different screen sizes, but just imagine how sophisticated our tools for screen layout will be in 25 years! God, can you imagine needing to _write code_ to move something over three pixels?

# annotations

The original vision of hypertext laid out in Vannevar Bush's "As We May Think" was as sort of academic tool -- a way to electronically annotate documents -- link sources to analyses to commentaries, for easy side-by-side reading.

This has some interesting use cases for journalists as well, like using annotations for editorial review and linking cited facts to their sources.

# no its becky

I've been talking a lot from the perspective of media professionals; what about the public? Hypermedia annotations can enable the public to share and respond to media, and perhaps even enable a form of "social media" where citizen publishers engage directly with each other.

# Pipes

Where do we fit in? We're building the infrastructure that all of this depends on. We're building the tools that hypermedia authors use, the low-level primitives and widgets that they use to compose their work.

# steps

Authors aren't a monolithic group. Some will be best supported with plug-and-play widgets, but others will be largely self-sufficient within the right frameworks. We'll have to build software with affordances for many skill levels.

Don't be fooled into thinking that just because we're taking a more supporting role that there's gonna be less work for us -- this will be a lot more challenging than pushing people aside and insisting we do it ourselves.

# ecosystem

I think I'm most excited about the possibilities of large-scale collaboration. With hypercard today, we're starting to see a community of people selling and sharing reusable stacks and widgets; one can only imagine how that could take off when internet access becomes cheap and widespread.

I foresee much of our future work as cultivating and maintaining this ecosystem -- unglamorous but necessary work, like hammering out specs and standards.

We'll also want to make sure that
