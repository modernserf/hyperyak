HyperCard as lens for user-friendly programming

---

# 1990

## Introduction to HyperCard
- Edit a text field
- Create a button/transition
- Show script editor
- Show "user level"

a programming language doesn't have to be good to be useful -- hypercard is string-oriented to the extreme, using comma-delimited strings as arrays

## Hypertext
- Ted Nelson / Xanadu
- NLS
- Notecards
	- reflections on weakness of hypertext

the restrictions of the document/link metaphor lift some of the weight of the Blank Page. It is useful even when it is discared, because it provides an entry point


## Bicycle for the Mind
- Smalltalk / Dynabook
- learn through discovery
- using is creating

apple's ideal in the 80s (and well into the mid 2000s) was the semi-professional/dilletante creative 

## Vision of the future
- CD-ROMs (a stopgap)
- Global HyperCard BBS
- HyperCard all the way down

## What we have

## What we gave up

## What could be

### Misplaced nostalgia

we do not need a "new hypercard", we need tools to bridge beginners and experts

hypercard's great strength was blurring app use and app development; the use of web apps provides an opportunity for user-driven expansion not present in native apps

debates about what the web is for are boring
the web is for people, not "hypertext"
what hypercard fundamentally got right was that it was ideologically impure — it was much more focused on providing an environment for experimentation than fulfilling any ideals about hypertext


### Amateurgramming

The value of hypercard isn't that its easy to use, but that its usable at many degrees of ability -- from non-programmer to expert. A beginner can start "playing" immediately, a professional can build a sellable product, and every skill level in between can find a niche.    

The web has fulfilled a similar role, but recent tools for web developers -- e.g. text editors, build tools, transpilers -- have focused on professionals while offering little for amateurs.

a beginner is able to do twice as much as they could in 1995, but an expert can do a thousand times as much. the power curve has gone from linear to exponential

when a task has its accidental complexity removed and if can be done with non-programmer tools it ceases to be called "programming". look towards tools that programmer chauvanism dismisses: excel, twine

Does this fit??

dichotomy between usability / generality:
- hypercard has a fairly specific model, it wasnt truly general purpose (e.g. compared to C)
- non-programmer productivity tools like excel/powerpoint are even less general purpose but also easier to use
- fundamental distinction is in extensibility -- hypercard could be used to make hypercard tools
- the webpage model is useful even when it is discared, because the document model provides an entry point
- but web is extendable to the point where you can simulate a whole OS on top of it
- curse of the blank page
- fred brooks, the tar pit

we barely understand how to write software; we definitely dont understsnd how to write software for writing software

So, what made you stop trying to learn how to code? I'm curious about the barriers that get erected.

The divide between “software for programmers” & “software for humans” does both a huge disservice. Bridging it should be a major priority.

> Where does HyperCard fit in the narrative of innovation? It's always tempting to go the condescending route and compare the program to, say, the optical telegraph, which was the magnetic telegraph's largely forgotten predecessor; or to John Logie Baird's mechanical television set, a forerunner to electronic TV; or to the cable/satellite music download experiments of Bill Von Meister, all of which tanked but eventually inspired America Online.

parser vs hypertext
parser vs command line ?

is parser in IF just a way of forcing arbitrary guess-the-verb?
